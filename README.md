# Ansible

This is quite simply my Ansible playbook and role repository.
It's public to the world as there is some stuff in here that 
other people might conceivably find useful. (It also makes
discussion with other Ansible nerds a little easier as they
can easily look at what I'm talking about).

## TODO

- Finish fixing auto updates (tyrion and bran work; sansa and theon do not -- also check gce)
- Write dynamic inventory script using a DNS AXFR as the underlaying datasource
* Rsnapshot user creation, home dir and keys
* Syslogd network and ufw configuration on mlt tranquil PCs
* Properly build and package up usb temper polling software
* Add standard header to all yaml files
* Convert all yaml files to full yaml format
* Add aptug equivelent to push updates to all hosts
* Add zabbix server to bran
* Add snipeit to bran
* Add tiger http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/en/man8/tiger.8.html
